# Platform-Game-2D-Neuron-Network (attempt) (2016-July)
This is attempt of creating platform game with neuron network which would be learning on player moves to play it. Unfortunetely I wasnt able to make neuron network learn correctly, so i decided to start with something easier.. detecting numbers

## Features
* Working base of platform game
* Money collecting system
* Recording player movement and feeding it to neuron network in loop
* Playing recorded game
* Letting neuron network play
* Randomise neuron network weights

## Controls 

* WASD - player movement
* Space - jump
* Right Alt - start recroding/stop recording
* Right Arrow - play recorded game
* Left Arrow - stop playing recorded game
* R - randomise neuron network weights
* Q - let neuron network start/stop playing
